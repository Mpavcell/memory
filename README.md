This is a personal project I made to test my Javascript, HTML and CSS skill thusfar.

It is a memory-game, where the player is tasked to flip two cards of the same kind. All cards are revealed, and only two cards can be revealed simultaneously. When two cards of the same type are revealed they remain revevealed. When two cards of a different type are revealed, they become white again when the player clicks a new card.

I am responsible for the decisions regarding the visual layout and coloring of the menus and the modals. However the graphics used for the cards themselves are vectors created by freepik.com.

I have credited freepik.com appropriately at the bottom of the scoreboard.

Play the game at mpavcell.github.io/memory

Have fun :)
